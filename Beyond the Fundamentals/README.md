<h3>Beyond the Fundamentals Course Notes</h1>

<h5>I. CHAPTER (COLLECTIONS)</h5>

1- Understanding Collections

==> Collections: Grouping multiple item together and storing them with a single name 

==> Organizing data in this way has few advantages

- Uses your code structure to indicate that multiple pieces of data are related
- Avoids creating a potentially huge number of variables to track within our code
- Offers simplefied syntax

2- A simple collection: 

==> List: Simple collection that groups pieces of data  together in a certain and assign the collection a name [array]

3- Dictionary: for storing related information [json in javascript]

<h5>II. CHAPTER (ITERATION)</h5>

1- Introduction to iteration

==> Iteration: repeats the same procedure mutiple times until it reaches a specified endpoint.

==> Loop: code that iterates, moving from beginning to end of process, than starting over.

==> To write code that iterates
  
  - Specify tha data
  - What should happen to the data during each iteration
  - Indicate whene the loop should stop

==> Infinite loop: bug that can occur whene the ending condition is omitted or specified incorrectly.
